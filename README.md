## ‚ùî What's new?
**<u>V0.2.x-pre</u>**

*Change of approach for SPI displays: they now use the FBTFT overlay directly instead of going through the Adafruit lib. For I2C screens, I've switched to Luma.oled.* 

**<u>You need to uninstall completely Olipi Moode</u>** if you have version v0.1.x installed:  

Retrieve the latest uninstall script:  
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OliPi-Project/olipi-moode/main/install/uninstall-olipi-moode.sh -o uninstall-olipi-moode.sh
```  
And executed the script:

```
sudo bash uninstall-olipi-moode.sh
```

> Release note:
>   - Improved  management of rotary encoder and its parameters in config.ini.
>   - Ready-script replaced by a systemd service with starting animation waiting for Moode to start. you can disable ready-script in Moode.
>   - It is no longer necessary to activate the "lcd updater", infos is retrieved via mpd or locally.
>   - FBTFT overlay for SPI screens.
>   - Luma.oled for I2C screens (Now you need to select the I2C address of your screen during installation).
>   - Setup script improved for install/update, with OliPi Moode folder backup.
>       - Now based on release version.
>       - Patch / Minor / Major Update are treated differently.
>       - Force new config.ini on major update with full install/configuration.
>       - Preserve config.ini and merge with .dist files on Minor update.
>       - Don't modify config.ini on Patch update.
>       - Backup existing configs before overwriting.
>       - Safe cleanup and move of cloned repo files.
>       - Use dedicaced section `# --- Olipi-moode ---` and `# @marker:***` on config.txt.
>   - A small performance improvement for Pi zero 2w / Pi3 A/B+ with highter screen resolution (still a lot of work to do).
>       - refresh_interval is now set according to the model of raspberry detected. 
>       - SPI speed and buffer size is now set according to the model of screen selected.
>   - Improved spectrometer.
>       - More audio formats supported.
>       - Now spectro releases the loopback when a track changes (Output format is no longer locked to the format read at opening).
>   - Delete some options and clean up config.ini
>   - And other odds and ends...

## ‚ú® Features

- **Now Playing UI**: Displays the current track, metadata, playback status, hardware info, etc. Media controls, add/remove favorites (follows the playlist configured in Moode), playback modes, renderers (Bluetooth, Airplay, and UPNP), search for the currently playing artist in the music library‚Ä¶ And a little extra: Logs radio track titles (via the "favorites" button) into a text file to list them in the menu, and lets you search them via yt-dlp and replay them via a local stream/radio (no download).
- **Browser UI**: Browse the mpd music library, search, move, copy, delete to/from local or USB storage.
- **Playlist/Queue UI**: Display and manage the playback queue. Can create or replace Playlist from queue.
- **Configuration help and IR remote mapping**: Assisted and fully customizable LIRC configuration with conflict detection. Ability to add custom actions to unused keys in OliPi MoOde (see the `handle_custom_key` function in `media_key_actions.py`... *to be made more user-friendly*).
- **GPIO button and rotary encoder support** using `rpi_lgpio` . Enable and configure pins in `config.ini` under the "manual" section.


## üì¶ System requirements

- **Operating system**: Moode Audio Player ‚â• 9.3.7 required.

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi (Zero 2W, 3, 4, 5) + I2C or SPI screen. An IR receiver type TSOP38 and/or push buttons and/or rotary encoder with or without push
  
  Screens supported:
  
  | Screen      | Resolution | Diag (") | PPI | Color      | Script                       |

## üöÄ Installation

**<u>If you have [MoodeOled](https://github.com/Trachou2Bois/MoodeOled) installed</u>**, check [**here**](https://github.com/Trachou2Bois/MoodeOled/blob/main/README.md#moodeoled-has-grown) to **uninstall it** before install OliPi Moode.

First of all:
- if you have already installed Olipi Moode check [here](#-whats-new) if new version require uninstalling.
- Make sure you've wired your screen, buttons and IR receiver correctly.
[See wiring guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#wiring--screen-does-not-turn-on-after-installation).

After that you can:

1. Clone this repository:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install git
   git clone https://github.com/OliPi-Project/olipi-moode
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   
   ```bash
   python3 ~/olipi-moode/install/install_olipi.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions.  
   
       This script performs the following actions:
       
       - Detects Moode version.
       - Installs APT dependencies.
       - Clone latest release from olipi-core
       - Offers to select from supported screens
       - Configures I¬≤C or SPI if disabled.
       - Offers to fill in the pins for SPI or select I2C adress
       - Offers ZRAM configuration if 512MB RAM and/or swap detected.
       - Creates a virtual environment (`~/.olipi-moode-venv` by default).
       - Install Python dependencies in venv.
       - Installs systemd services.
       - Append some lines with useful commands to .profile
       - Create file with versions and paths in install dir.
       
       It can be reused for update OliPi Moode or force reinstall  

4. ‚ùó <u>Moode configuration reminder</u>

    To display the spectrometer you need to enable loopback in Moode UI: `configure > Audio > ALSA Options`. And change `show_spectrum = false` to `true` in `~/olipi-moode/config.ini`.

## üñ• Services

The following systemd services are created during installation:

| Service               | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `olipi-ui-playing`    | Displays "Now Playing" screen (ui_playing.py)    |
| `olipi-ui-browser`    | Music library navigation (ui_browser.py)         |
| `olipi-ui-queue`      | Playback queue display (ui_queue.py)             |
| `olipi-starting-wait` | Launch ui_wait.py at startup for waiting Moode   |
| `olipi-ui-off`        | Turns off (clear) screen at shutdown (ui_off.py) |

Switch between the 3 main display scripts using the `KEY_BACK` button.  
Service `olipi-ui-off` is enabled and execute ui_off.py for clearing display at shutdown. (Need better handling for turning off LCD backlight)
Service `olipi-starting-wait` is enabled and launch ui_wait.py who play animation for waiting Moode to be ready.

## üì° IR remote configuration

OliPi MoOde includes an interactive script to configure LIRC:

```bash
python3 ~/olipi-moode/install/install_lirc_remote.py
```

Features:

- Install and configure LIRC.
- Hardware test (`mode2`, `irw`).
- Download a configuration from `irdb-get`.
- Learn a remote control (`irrecord`).
- Move *.lircd.conf to /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d
- Manage/edit *.lircd.conf stored in /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d
- Mapping editor:
  - Reassign all keys or individually.
  - Conflict detection (confirmation if a key is already mapped).
  - Warning if mapping a system key (e.g., `KEY_UP`).

Mappings are stored in `config.ini`:

```ini
[remote_mapping]
#KEY_OLIPIMOODE = YOUR_REMOTE_KEY
# Required keys
KEY_PLAY = KEY_PLAYPAUSE
KEY_BACK = KEY_ESC
...
# Optional keys
KEY_FORWARD = KEY_FASTFORWARD
KEY_NEXT = KEY_NEXTSONG
```

## üéõ GPIO and rotary encoder support

OliPi MoOde uses `rpi_lgpio`, you can configure GPIO buttons or rotary encoders in `config.ini`. Be careful not to use pins that are used for other things. Check your hardware and wiring before enabling "use_buttons" and "use_rotary""

Example:

```ini
[input]
use_buttons = true
use_rotary = true

[buttons]
KEY_LEFT = 17
KEY_RIGHT = 27

[rotary]
pin_a = 22
pin_b = 23
```

## üîß Configuration via tools menu in Now Playing UI

A small on-screen configuration menu allows you to change:

- Screen sleep delay  
- Local stream quality (radio favorites)  
- Language (currently English and French)  
- Enable/disable debug mode  
- Change color theme


## üß† ZRAM on low-memory devices

If your Raspberry Pi has **512MB RAM** (e.g., Zero 2W or 3 A+):

- The installer offers to install `zram-tools` and configure ZRAM (256 MB, lz4).
- Completely disables swap.


## üîß Uninstall

You can uninstall all without leaving any residue with the following command:

`sudo bash ~/olipi-moode/install/uninstall-olipi-moode.sh`
